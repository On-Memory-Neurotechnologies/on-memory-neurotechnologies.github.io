              "Based on the symptoms you described and some of the tests that I ran, you qualify for a diagnosis of early stage dementia . Because you have no other major health problems like stroke, brain tumors, and we’ve ruled out a reaction to medication, the mostly likely explanation is that this dementia is caused by the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. I know this isn’t easy news to hear but I want to share some more information with you about what that means and what we can do to support you. Do you want to take a moment before I go on? Or can I get you anything? Maybe a glass of water?",
              "Here you are. Let me know when you’re ready to keep going.",
              "Alright. As you probably already know, dementia is characterized by memory loss and Alzheimer’s is a brain condition that causes dementia. It starts out small, forgetting things like when or where something has happened or is supposed to happen, like your shifts at the shelter. You might also have a hard time finding the right words for something. As the disease progresses, you and your family might notice other changes.",
              "Alzheimer’s first affects an area of the brain called the hippocampus. When the hippocampus is functioning normally, it records new memories, for example, the name of a person you’re meeting for the first time. When you see that person again, the hippocampus helps you retrieve the memory of that name so you can say, “Hi, Ben!” When Alzheimer’s is affecting the hippocampus, it’s harder to make new memories. That’s why you might have forgotten when you were scheduled for volunteering at the shelter or forgotten you had asked a question just a few minutes before.",
              'We can’t know for sure how Alzheimer"s will affect you specifically. It’s a little different for everyone. But yes, that is a possibility. The good news is that while we cannot cure Alzheimer’s disease, you have many treatment options available to you. Now that we’ve talked a little just the two of us, would it be alright for us to invite your husband, Paul, in from the waiting room? The three of us can go over those treatment options.',

            [
              "Ok, now that we’ve gone through the test results, let’s talk treatment.",
              "Perhaps, yes. Pharmaceutical drugs are one option. There are a few different drugs that can help with the memory loss symptoms. To work properly, they must be taken every day and they can slow the progression of the symptoms by about six months.",
              "Yes, those things can help a little too. Making sure you do things to keep your body and mind active can help your brain be more flexible. That way if one part stops working so well due to the Alzheimer’s, another part that is less affected by the disease can compensate.",
              "That’s a great idea. There’s one more option to tell you about. It’s called a memory prosthesis.",
              "Yes it’s sort of like that. Just like a prosthetic leg can help someone who lost their natural leg resume functions like walking, the memory prosthesis can help do some of the functions that your natural memory can no longer perform.",
              "Exactly, it goes in the brain. Remember I mentioned that Alzheimer’s begins in the hippocampus? The part of the brain that helps you make new memories. Because you’re in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, Pat, you may be a candidate for a hippocampal prosthesis.",
              "Yes, we perform a surgery to insert the memory prosthesis. During the surgery, we open the skull and insert a small implant in the hippocampus. It uses electrical stimulation to mimic the natural functions of the hippocampus. The implant works as the prosthesis to help your hippocampus continue forming new memories. Electrical stimulation of the brain is used in many therapies for brain-based diseases. For example, some Parkinson’s disease patients choose  deep brain stimulation to treat their tremor symptoms and it can be very effective.",
              "Paul is right that the surgery does come with some risks, similar to any other brain surgery. You would spend a day or two in the hospital afterward and a full recovery takes 4-8 weeks. We would make sure that you are a good candidate in terms of your physical health before pursuing this treatment option. As for how long the prosthesis is effective, it’s a little different for each person. It won’t stop the progression of the disease or stop memory loss entirely, but you might feel like your memory goes back to working closer to what it was like when you were younger and it might help slow down the loss of memory.",
              "If this is an option you want to consider, I would run a few more tests to confirm whether you are a good candidate for surgery. You can still take some time to decide what you’d like to do.",
              "That sounds like a good plan. In case you decide to go with the prosthesis, we can start the process of making sure you’d be a good candidate for surgery now. Should I go ahead and order those tests?",
