<!--          The year is 2035. Pat is a 72-year old woman. She has a husband, two-->
<!--          adult children, and three grandkids. For 30 years she worked as a-->
<!--          librarian, but she retired 7 years ago and has volunteered three days-->
<!--          per week at the local animal shelter ever since.-->
<!--        </p>-->
<!--        <p>-->
<!--          Recently, she started mixing up the times of her shifts at the-->
<!--          shelter. Her family also began to notice her repeating questions like,-->
<!--          “what’s everyone doing this weekend?” within a short period of time.-->
<!--        </p>-->
<!--        <p>-->
<!--          After a trip to her GP and a referral to a Neurologist, Pat is-->
<!--          diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.-->

<!--        It’s hard to imagine yourself in Pat’s shoes but for many of us,-->
<!--        Alzheimer’s disease will affect our lives in some way. It is estimated-->
<!--        that 5.8 million Americans over the age of 65 have Alzheimer’s disease.-->
<!--        With such a high prevalence, it’s likely that Alzheimer’s will touch-->

<!--        Alzheimer’s disease and other dementia-related memory loss are the focus-->
<!--        of an entire research field, and scientists are working every day to not-->

<!--        memories in dementia patients. In the year 2050, memory prostheses like-->

<!--          Over the next two years, Pat (now aged 74) experiences more advanced-->

<!--          names when she chats with them and sometimes forgets who she is-->
<!--          speaking with. She is also beginning to need help with daily-->
<!--          functioning tasks like choosing her clothes in the morning, and-->
<!--          remembering to eat. Pat’s husband provides her with daily support for-->
<!--          these tasks and he reports that, “some days are better than others.”-->

<!--          Over the next five years, Pat (now aged 79) shows further AD-related-->

<!--          several occasions, Pat has accused her husband of having an affair.-->
<!--          She has also made some inappropriate remarks to her 10 y.o.-->
<!--          granddaughter. After these moments of agitation, Pat seems to “go back-->
